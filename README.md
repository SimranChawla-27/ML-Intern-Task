Hyperspectral Data Analysis for vomitoxin_ppb Prediction
Overview
This project analyzes a hyperspectral dataset containing spectral reflectance data from corn samples to predict the concentration of  vomitoxin_ppb . The analysis includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE, and model training using a Random Forest Regressor. The performance of the model is evaluated using various regression metrics.
